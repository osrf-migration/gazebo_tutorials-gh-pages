We definitely need to update the tutorials as we're going through a transition right now.\n\nI think it's a little too early to have users adopt `ign-cmake`, so a smaller step forward might be warranted. Right now I'm putting together an alternative fix for this that involves checking out the `ign-math3` branch of `ign-math` so that `ign-cmake` isn't needed at all. I'll post an update when that PR is ready. The instructions in this PR may still be very useful down the road, once we're ready to fully deploy `ign-cmake`, so we should definitely hang onto this, or redirect it to another branch until we're ready to merge it into `default`.\n\nAlso, we've discussed using `vcpkg`, and we're very interested in its potential.
