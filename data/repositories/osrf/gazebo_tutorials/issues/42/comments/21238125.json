Every time I tried to install gazebo6 I've used sudo apt-get update. The source list is updated.\nNow I've installed the full ros indigo package and it worked for me.

But it didn't work.\nI've also verified all the dependencies by dpkg -l manually and they are in place except libgazebo6 and libsdformat3.\nI manaully installed libgazebo6 which also resolved libsdformat3.\nEven though all dependencies are in place still I was not able to run gazebo6.\nSadly installing libgazebo6 also removed the gazebo which was installed from ros-indigo package.\nI've attached screenshot of apt-cache show gazebo6\nPlease open the attached image in new tab.\n![gazebo6_install_try4.jpg](data/bitbucket.org/repo/RMMxjX/images/3668580247-gazebo6_install_try4.jpg)\n\nThanks\nPradeep", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Steven,</p>\n<p>Thanks for reply.
