For example, for Gazebo ```4.0 ```\nwe are using ```sdf 2.0```, for the ```5.0``` - ```2.3``` and in the default - ```sdf3```.\nAlso I faced problem running Gazebo after installation and I discovered that in versions greater than Trusty libraries are placed not simply in ```/local/lib```, but in  ```/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu```, so that Gazebo command cannot be found. Of course, related path in the tutorial should be updated.\n\nAll this might be not clear to the people who are new to Gazebo and are installing it first time. I thought that adding it as notes to existing tutorials can make them confusing. \n\n\nThank you anyway for pointing this out! I will keep this in mind for my future contributions.\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Louise,</p>\n<p>You are right it is issue <a href=\"#!/osrf/gazebo_tutorials/issues/22/add-install-from-source-instructions-for\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Add install from source instructions for gazebo5\" class=\"ap-connect-link\">#22</a>.</p>\n<p>The differences between the three tutorials are the versions of DART and SDF to be installed.
